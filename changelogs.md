# _SPEEDRUNNER MOD v.1.0.0 (Released March 1st, 2021) CHANGELOG_

• Completely Changes Piglin Trades. Ender Pearls are now x5 more common, piglins will now drop 9-34 Cooked Porkchop upon bartering, piglins have a higher chance to 
drop spectral arrows (7-37), splash fire resistance potions, string (8-14), and obsidian (1-3). 
There are also very rare items that can be obtained from bartering such as: Golden Apples, Enchanted Golden Apples, and Blaze Powder.

• Animals such as Pigs, Cows, Sheep, Chicken, Rabbits, Cod and Salmon can now drop 1-9 raw food instead of only 1-3 raw food.

• You can cook all food types (porkchop, beef, mutton, chicken, rabbit, cod and salmon) in only one second in a furnace or smoker to save a lot of time.

• Blazes now have a 100% blaze rod drop rate. This means every time you kill a blaze, it has a 100% chance of dropping a blaze rod, instead of 50-50. 
Blazes also have a chance to drop golden nuggets, gold ingots, and gold blocks.

• Structure loot, such as ruined portals, bastions, shipwrecks, chests in strongholds (excluding the library chests), villages, and desert temples 
have been revamped to have x5 better loot. Diamonds, gold, iron, etc, are now a lot more common in these structures. 
Enchanted Golden Apples and Golden Apples are also more common in Bastions and Desert Temples.

• All logs, including stripped, stone and coal ore, can now drop a maximum of 1-2 blocks instead of only 1. Netherrack can drop a maximum of 3 blocks.

• Nether Gold Ore can now drop more gold nuggets, 9-36 nuggets per time mined.

• Buckets, flint and steels, shears, and anvils can be crafted using the Speedrunner Ingots/Blocks.

• Iron ore and Gold ore will now drop ingots instead of the ore itself to save lots of time.

• Adds two new ores, "Speedrunner Ore", and "Speedrunner Nether Ore" The Speedrunner Ore generates all across the overworld, 
and is about as common as Iron Ore. When Mined, this ore will drop one Speedrunner Ingot and a small amount of XP. 
If you use the enchantment "Silk Touch" on the ore, you will get the Ore itself. If you use "Fortune", you will get x3 more ingots instead of just one. 
The same goes for the "Speedrunner Nether Ore", except it generates in the nether, and when mined, it will drop 2-6 Speedrunner Nuggets, instead of ingots.

• Adds two new items, "Speedrunner Ingot", and "Speedrunner Nugget". 
The Speedrunner ingot, along with the Speedrunner Nugget, can be obtained from the Speedrunner (Nether) Ore, and can also generate in most structures 
(Villages, Bastions, Ruined Portals, Desert Temples, Shipwrecks, and Stronghold chests). 
The Speedrunner Ingot can be crafted using 9 speedrunner nugget, and the Speedrunner Nugget can be crafted using 1 Speedrunner Ingot. 
Both the Speedrunner Ingots and Nuggets can ALSO be obtained from piglin bartering.

• Adds 5 new tools, "Speedrunner Sword", "Speedrunner Pickaxe", "Speedrunner Axe", "Speedrunner Shovel", and "Speedunner Hoe". 
These 5 items can be obtained from crafting them using the Speedrunner Ingot, the way you craft them is the same way you would craft any other tool. 
These tools are better than iron tools, but worse than diamond tools. For Example, the Iron Sword has an attack damage of 6, 
the Speedrunner Sword has an attack damage of 6.5, and the Diamond Sword has an attack damage of 7. It's Enchantment value is "8". 
The Enchantment value is how lucky you get with enchants on the enchantment table. For Example, 
Wooden tools have an enchantment value of 15, stone has 5, iron has 14, diamond has 10, and gold has 22.

• Adds 4 new armor pieces, "Speedrunner Helmet", "Speedrunner Chestplate", "Speedrunner Leggings", and "Speedrunner Boots". 
These 4 armor pieces can be obtained from crafting them using Speedrunner Ingots, the way you craft them is the same way you would craft any other armor piece. 
These armor pieces are better than iron tools, but worse than diamond tools. For Example, the Iron Chestplate has a protection value of 6 (0 armor toughness), 
the Speedrunner Chestplate has a protection value of 7 (+1 armor toughness), and the Diamond Chestplate has a protection value of 8 (+2 armor toughness). 
It's enchantment value is "11" (For Example, Leather has an enchantment value of 15, iron has 9, chainmail has 12, diamond has 10, and gold has 25).

• Adds a new block, "Speedrunner Block"! This block can be crafted using 9 speedrunner ingots, and can only be found in bastions.

• Adds 3 new advancements, "Speedrunning Time", for getting a Speedrunner Ingot, "Isn't It Speedrunning Time?" (I know it's cringe shut up lol), 
for getting a Speedrunner Pickaxe, and finally, "Suited for Speedrunning", for getting a piece of Speedrunner Armor.

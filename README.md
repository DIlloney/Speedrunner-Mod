# _SPEEDRUNNER MOD_
A Minecraft mod that makes Minecraft Speedrunning easier.

Hello, everyone! This is my first ever mod, the **_Speedrunner Mod!_**
_This is the official github page, where all of the important information regarding the mod are located. All changelogs will be posted in this file._

This mod changes the Vanilla aspects of **_Minecraft Speedrunning_** and _completely_ overhauls it! More details below...

# _MOD INFORMATION_

**_Supported Minecraft Versions:_** _1.16.3 and 1.16.5_

**_Supported Mod Loaders:_** Fabric and Forge (sadly, the forge version has officially been discontiuned. I don't know if I will ever continue it in the future, forge is
just very difficulty to code with).

**_Requirements:_** _Fabric Mod Loader (https://fabricmc.net/use/) + Fabric API (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/3248105)_

Make sure to join the **_Official Speedrunner Mod Discord_** (https://discord.gg/Qu8utnCwkq) for more information regarding the mod, leaderboards page, and Dilloney's PBs!

**_<!> Important Note <!>:_** If you are looking into submitting official speedruns on speedrun.com, this is *not* the mod for you, as your run will be immediately rejected, as the features this mods adds completely changes vanilla speedrunning, such as piglin trades, structure loot, and adds new items/armor pieces. This mod is recommended for beginner speedrunners, or if you are just looking to have fun with speedrunning.

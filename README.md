# Speedrunner-Mod
A Minecraft mod that makes Minecraft Speedrunning easier.

Hello, everyone! This is my first ever mod, the **_Speedrunner Mod!_**
_This is the official github page, where all of the important information regarding the mod are located. All changelogs will be posted in this file._

This mod changes the Vanilla aspects of **_Minecraft Speedrunning_** and _completely_ overhauls it! More details below...

**___Mod Information___**

**_Supported Minecraft Versions:_** _1.16.3 and 1.16.5_

**_Supported Mod Loaders:_** Fabric and Forge (sadly, the forge version has officially been discontiuned. I don't know if I will ever continue it in the future, forge is
just very difficulty to code with).

**_Requirements:_** _Fabric Mod Loader (https://fabricmc.net/use/) + Fabric API (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/3248105)_

Make sure to join the **_Official Speedrunner Mod Discord_** (https://discord.gg/BxUycrNG) for more information regarding the mod, leaderboards page, and Dilloney's PBs!
